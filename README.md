# Question-Bank-Manager
ICS 108 Lab Project

In this application, the user will be able to create, view, edit, and delete multiple choice questions. Each question has a text, choices, and the correct answer.

The questions will be loaded from the binary file "QuestionBank.dat" when the application starts and saved back to the file upon exit.
